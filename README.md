## Introduction

This dataset compiles logs from a variety of monitoring tools that recorded interrupts and fatal streaming errors during a football match distributed by a German media broadcaster.
The analysis highlights the peak time range, duration of the issue, mitigation time, and distribution across the data. Perhaps the issue was related to a specific device, operating system, or internet service provider ?
